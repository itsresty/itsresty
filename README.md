## 👋 About Me  

Hi! I’m Resty 🌱

- 💻 Currently learning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and databases  
- 🚀 Exploring: React, Node.js, and other modern web technologies  
- 🎯 Goal: To contribute to real-world projects and grow into a skilled Full Stack Developer  
- 🌟 Motto: *“Keep learning, keep building, and never give up.”*  

I’m excited to share my projects here as I grow step by step. 💡
